# Advanced Data Management – Midterm Project (Part 3)

This repository contains the implementation of the Data Warehouse for Part 3 of the Advanced Data Management course.

It includes:
- Revised star schema design
- Python script for generating synthetic data (2014–2026)
- Population of more than 1,000,000 fact table records
- SQL queries supporting advanced ranking and moving average analysis

The data warehouse follows a dimensional modeling approach (Star Schema) and supports analytical queries involving ranking, city-level aggregation, browser-based online transactions, and time-series computations.
